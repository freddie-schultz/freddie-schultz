Currently ~~suffering~~ fighting writers' block.

- 👋 Hi, I’m Freddie Schultz, I am a full-stack web developer specializing in React.js, and with a background in end-user support and training/documentation.
- 👀 I’m interested in maths and physics, and building fun apps related to these (Fractal Generator in the works!)
- 🌱 Currently practising my React.js skills and using Co-pilot.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any small fun projects, or open source projects.
